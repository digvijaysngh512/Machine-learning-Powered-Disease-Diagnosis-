# Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning
Machine learning models in healthcare domain.
1. Breast Cancer Detection - using **KNN** and **SVM**
2. Diabetes Onset Detection - using **neural networks** and **grid search**
3. Cornonary Artery Disease (Heart Disease) Diagnosis - using **neural networks**
4. Autistic Spectrum Disorder (neurodevelopment disorder) Diagnosis - using simple **neural network**
5. Except Autism Data is fetched using API
The datasets were obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Developed model for coronary artery disease diagnosis on the 303-patient UCI dataset, with 94% accuracy..
### Built models for multiple conditions (breast cancer, diabetes, autism, heart disease) with 99% accuracy.
### Improved interpretability and speed by applying binary classification and neural network optimization
